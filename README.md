Project 1 for ECEN 689 course involved gathering health and income data for the United States.

## Datasets used

The first dataset is  “Food Environment Atlas”. Food environment factors interact to influence food choices and diet quality. 
The objectives of the Food Atlas, made available by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, are to assemble statistics on food environment indicators and to provide a spatial overview of access to healthy food. The atlas contains health and well-being indicators such as diabetes and obesity rates.

The current version of the Food Environment Atlas has over 275 variables, including new indicators on access and proximity to a grocery store for sub populations; an indicator on the SNAP Combined Application Project for recipients of Supplemental Security Income (at the State level). Indicators on farmers' markets that report accepting credit cards or report selling baked and prepared food products. Data was used for the years 2008 and 2013.
The second dataset is “County Income Tax Statistics”. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the revenue service of the United States federal government. 
It is responsible for collecting taxes and administering the Internal Revenue Code. Public information includes individual tax statistics for 2016, grouped by FIPS code.
