# deliverables 


* modular components for project 1:

1) mapping the health data to income data for each county.
2) using statistical models for comparing the two datasets for each county.
3) gathering sources from the literature to support our claims
4) compiling our findings (graphs, discussions, conclusions, etc) into an 8-page report.
